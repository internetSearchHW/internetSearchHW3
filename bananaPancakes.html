						<li>To a large mixing bowl, add bananas and mash until only small bits remain.</li>

						<li>Then add baking powder and vanilla extract and use a fork or whisk to mash until thoroughly
							combined.</li>

						<li>Next add eggs, break yolks with a fork or whisk, and whisk thoroughly until well combined.
						</li>

						<li>Lastly, add coconut flour 1 Tbsp (9 g) at a time until a thick but scoopable batter is
							achieved (thicker than your average pancake batter, but not so thick that it appears dry).
							If you add too much coconut flour, add a little dairy-free milk to thin.</li>

						<li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add a little cooking oil to coat the pan.
						</li>

						<li>Then spoon in roughly 3-Tbsp amounts of batter and reduce heat to low. These benefit from
							cooking slower and lower than your average pancakes. Cover with a lid to help the center
							cook through.</li>

						<li>Cook for 3-4 minutes, then remove lid and flip carefully. Cook for 3-4 minutes more
							(lowering heat as needed if cooking too fast) or until the underside is golden brown.
							Continue cooking until all batter is used up — as recipe is written, ~6 pancakes.</li>

						<li>To serve, top with desired toppings, such as nut butter, sliced bananas or fresh fruit,
							dairy-free yogurt, or maple syrup. We also love a sprinkle of seeds for more fiber and
							healthy fats.</li>

						<li>Enjoy!</li>

						<h3>Notes</h3>
					</header>

					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>You can easly change the recipe, just remember - one banana per one egg!</li>
						<li>Best when fresh, though leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator 3-4 days, or in the
							freezer up to 1 month. To reheat, microwaving is most effective. Otherwise, toast or bake in
							a 180 C (350 degree F) oven until hot.</li>
